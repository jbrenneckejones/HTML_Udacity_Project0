        <b> Computers Listen </b>
                <p> Computers are only told what to do so if someone makes a compiler error then the whole program will crash. All the computer does is what you tell it to do. </p>
        
        <b> HTML - Hypertext Markup Language </b>
        <p> HTML is a markup language which is a way of annotating a document to distinguish it from text. HTML can be composed of multiple different document types like text, images, hyperlinks and etc. More information can be found <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">here</a href> </p>

        <b> HTML Tags and Elements </b>
        <p> Tags and elements tell HTML how to format and show different text and images and it's what HTML is composed of. More information on the different tag types and what they do can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/"> here </a> </p>

        <b> Block text versus inline </b>
            <p> Block type elements have to have a begin and an end and usually renders the text inside of a block seperate from the regular inline text, one example would be the bold element. Making sure to end your block is really important because it will continue to render the rest of the text in the block where you started the element. Inline elements can be used right in the middle of text and doesn't render the text to a block format, one example would be the line break element. </p>
